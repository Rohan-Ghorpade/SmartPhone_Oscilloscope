INTRODUCTION
In the realm of electronics, oscilloscopes and waveform generators are indispensable tools for analyzing and manipulating electrical signals. They play a crucial role in diagnostics, testing, and the development of various electronic systems. However, the high cost of these instruments often puts them out of reach for beginners, hobbyists, and small-scale experimenters. This project aims to bridge that gap by offering an affordable alternative: a DIY Smartphone Oscilloscope using the Raspberry Pi Pico and a Waveform Generator using the Arduino Nano.
The DIY Smartphone Oscilloscope leverages the capabilities of the Raspberry Pi Pico, a versatile and cost-effective microcontroller. By interfacing with a smartphone via an OTG (On-The-Go) connection and using software like Scoppy, this setup can display real-time electrical waveforms on the smartphone screen. This solution provides a significant advantage over traditional multimeters, which are unable to capture transient or rapidly changing signals. The DIY oscilloscope offers a practical and economical approach for electronics enthusiasts and professionals alike, making signal analysis accessible to a broader audience.


In parallel, the Waveform Generator project utilizes the Arduino Nano to produce various waveforms, including sine, square, and triangular waves. The generator offers adjustable frequency and amplitude, making it a versatile tool for testing and experimentation. While not intended for industrial-grade applications, this DIY waveform generator serves as an excellent educational tool and a valuable resource for hobby projects. It demonstrates the potential of microcontroller-based systems in creating functional and useful electronic devices.
Together, these projects not only provide essential tools for electronics experimentation but also foster a deeper understanding of the underlying principles of signal generation and analysis. This introduction sets the stage for exploring the detailed construction, setup, and functionality of the DIY Smartphone Oscilloscope and Waveform Generator, highlighting their significance and practicality in modern electronics exploration.

 
Theoretical Background
1. Definition and Purpose An oscilloscope is a crucial instrument used in electronics to visualize and analyze electrical signals. It displays the waveform of a signal, showing how the voltage varies over time. This visualization helps in understanding the signal's behavior, frequency, amplitude, and other key characteristics.

2. Types of Oscilloscopes
•	Analog Oscilloscopes: These use cathode ray tubes (CRTs) to display signals. They are known for their continuous signal representation but are largely obsolete due to digital advancements.
•	Digital Oscilloscopes: These capture and digitize signals using analog-to-digital converters (ADCs). They offer advanced features like storage, signal processing, and multiple trigger options, making them more versatile and widely used today.
